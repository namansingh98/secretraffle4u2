          <h2 className="text-xl mb-5 mt-5">9. Your legal rights</h2>
          <p>
            At any point while we are in possession of or processing your
            personal data, you have the following rights:
            <br />
            <br />
            a. Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data
            subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
            personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
            processing it.
            <br />
            <br />
            b. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
            This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
            about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of
            the new data you provide to us.
            <br />
            <br />
            c. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us
            to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for
            us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to
            delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
            exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
            may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
            required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
            however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request
            of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you,
            if applicable, at the time of your request.
            <br />
            <br />
            d. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying
            on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
            something about your particular situation which makes you want to
            object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
            fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
            where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
            purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
            legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
            rights and freedoms. If you still wish to exercise your right to
            object, we may have to terminate your account or cancel a bet you
            have placed with us but we will notify you if this is the case at
            the time.
            <br />
            <br />
            e. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
            enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
            data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the
            data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you
            do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data
            even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
            exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use
            of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
            legitimate grounds to use it.
            <br />
            <br />
            f. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
            party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
            your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
            format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
            which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
            the information to perform a contract with you.
            <br />
            <br />
            g. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
            process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
            lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
            consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
            certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is
            the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please
            contact the DPO.
            <br />
            <br />
            No fees usually required
            <br />
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
            exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request
            in these circumstances.
            <br />
            <br />
            What we may need from you
            <br />
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us
            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
            data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
            measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
            who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
            for further information in relation to your request to speed up our
            response.
            <br />
            <br />
            Time limit in responding back
            <br />
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
            Occasionally it may take us longer than this if your request is
            particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
            case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
