            at the time of the relevant Betting Event or, if a Bet receipt shows
            a Bet ID number or a status with an identical meaning, only in such
            an event is the Player entitled to any Winnings pursuant to that
            Bet. The order receipt confirmation sent by email or the status
            “Submitted”, or in the case of “pending” or a status with an
            identical meaning only indicate that Secret Raffle 4U has received
            the order for a Bet, not that it has been accepted. Only with the
            status “In My Account”, or “accepted”, in the overview, shall the
            Bet be deemed accepted. Where a Bet is not accepted prior to the
            Betting Event taking place, Secret Raffle 4U will refund the value
            of the Stake to the Player.

            Account” Secret Raffle 4U reserves the right to cancel the raffle
            games element of the Bet. In either of the events aforementioned in

            price of the games affected.
